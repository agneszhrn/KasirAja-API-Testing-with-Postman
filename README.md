<h1 align="center">KasirAja API Testing using Postman</h1>

I use Postman as a tool to do API Testing for the KasirAja application. There are 35 tests and 152 test cases with each assertion.

To start testing, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Open Postman application.
3. Import the `KasirAja API Testing.postman_collection` file to Postman.
4. Run the collection.

Or you can also access KasirAja API Testing Documenter:
